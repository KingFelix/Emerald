## About

My name is Gabriel and I'm a consultant, programmer, and project manager with a multinational consultancy firm. I started to learn coding in 2015 and have been working on building up my skills ever since. My main areas of interest are data analysis/data science, web development and business intelligence and I mainly work with Python, R, Qlik, Excel VBA and related tools and libraries.   

### Continuous learning
I am a vocal advocate of continuous learning and self-development thus I spend a good part of my time researching new tools and studying new methods to improve my work. I strongly believe that every self-respecting professional must dedicate time to improve in order to remain competitive.      

I blog about the things I research, technology, coding, software development, dev community and everything else I find interesting and could benefit others.

### How do you contact me?
Drop me an email at [shiftplusreturn@gmail.com](mailto:shiftplusreturn@gmail.com). As soon as new channels of communication will be available  will update the page and you will find them here.

### What is the meaning of shift+return?
It's a keyboard shortcut you would use in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, for running the code in the current cell and then jumping on to the next one. If the next cell does not exist, a new one is created. Here, we're in the realm of studying and learning thus, in this particular context, the blog name is meant to convey the message that one should always go forward with their personal and professional development through learning. One should always be curious and, as soon as the current project comes to an end, they should go on to finding a new one. In other words, keep on moving, never stop!  

Stay curious!
