Hi! I'm Max, and in August I'll be a Freshman at Duke University, where I hope to study either math, economics, statistics, computer science, or some combination of these subjects. Through this blog I hope to document any interesting intellectual projects I may be working on, cool stuff I find online, current events, book reviews, or anything else I find interesting. Please check back in the future for new posts. Thanks for visiting!
