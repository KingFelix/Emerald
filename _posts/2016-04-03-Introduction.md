Hi! I'm Max. In August I'll be a Freshman at Duke University, where I hope to study some combination of math, economics, statistics, computer science, or some combination of these subjects. 
Through this blog I hope to document intellectual projects on which I am working, cool things I find online, current events, book reviews, and anything else I find interesting. Please check back in the future for new posts. 

Thanks for visiting!
