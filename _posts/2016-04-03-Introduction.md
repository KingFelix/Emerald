Hi! I'm Max. In August I'll be a Freshman at Duke University, where I hope to study some combination of math, economics, statistics, or computer science. 
On this blog, I'll document my personal/school projects, cool things I find online, current events, and anything else I find interesting. Please check back in the future for new posts. 

Thanks for visiting!
