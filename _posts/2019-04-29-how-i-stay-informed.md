Mainly by checking the Google News feed on my smartphone every morning. It’s a good aggregator and I configured it to show me what’s been published recently, in my areas of interest. The AI behind it will also keep track of your google searches and update your feed accordingly. It’s also available via web browser at [news.google.com]( <https://news.google.com/>) but I personally prefer the app that is integrated with my phone’s OS.

After having a quick look at the feed contents I go on reading the articles that interest me and bookmark the longer ones, that I do not have time to read in the morning or those that need further study. 

I also configured my LinkedIn feed in the same way and every now and then something interesting like [this](< https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6523598198383091712>) pops up. 

Another, more proactive, approach would be to actively search for resources on dedicated websites. I usually do this when I need to solve a problem and, at least for me, this is the way that works best. I always check the documentation of whatever tool/programming language/library I’m using but sometimes it’s not enough. Below a list of my usual go-to places for resources:
-    [stackoverflow.com](< https://stackoverflow.com/>), in my humble opinion, the best Q&A site on the web 
-    [github.com](< https://github.com/>) where you can usually find software projects, but it also contains very helpful discussions about how to fix or overcome bugs and other known problems for some of the tools that developers use 
-    [medium.com](<https://medium.com/>) and its sister sites [hackernoon.com](< https://hackernoon.com/>), [towardsdatascience.com](< https://towardsdatascience.com/>), [medium.freecodecamp.com](<https://medium.freecodecamp.org/>) have very good articles about very much everything you can think of, probably also one that solves your problem
-    [dev.to](< https://dev.to/>), similar to medium.com
-    [realpython.com](< https://realpython.com/>), very good guides and tutorials on all things Python
-    [css-tricks.com](< https://css-tricks.com/>), resources on web development with particular focus on CSS
-    [w3schools.com](< https://www.w3schools.com/>), quick guides and examples on the syntax of statements and other concepts in various programming languages
-    [techonthenet.com](< https://www.techonthenet.com/>), similar to W3Schools

I also maintain a list in [Keep](< https://keep.google.com/>), with the things I found interesting and think might be useful in the future. It’s short and concise containing either the name of the tool/technology I want to remember or the link to a webpage (company, product, article, etc.). It’s very useful as when I finally decide to use something I found during my research I don’t have to try to remember or go back to my Chrome history (yes, I mainly use Chrome because it’s well integrated with the other Google tools that are part of my arsenal).

And finally, there’s an offline component to all of this. It is very important to keep oneself updated with all that is new but it’s at least as important to also get to personally know and interact with like-minded individuals. 

About two years ago I started working as an expat and I kind of struggled because I did not know anyone in the new country of residence. After a bit of research, I eventually stumbled upon [meetup.com](< https://www.meetup.com/>)  that was and still is of much help. After creating an account it allows you to search for groups of people that organize “meetups” on various subjects in the immediate geographical area. You can then enroll in the groups that interest you and you’ll be able to see all the meetings they organize, where they are held, and other useful information.  Should you not find a meetup near you, you can choose to organize one and make the information available to other interested parties.  It helped me find a community to be part of, it would surely help you too.

This is my method of staying informed and up-to-date but I am very curious about how you guys do it. Drop me an email or leave me a comment with your way of doing things or/and anything you wish to add.
