We often underestimate the impact that a single decision can have on our life. What seems like a no-brainer in the present can have devastating impact in the long-term. Many times, the decisions that hurt us most are the decisions that are made without a consideration for long-term optionality. At the end of our lives, our success or lack of success is oftentimes the sum of a million decisions.  Those who achieve high-levels of success are the ones who manage to make more good decisions than bad decisions. Optionality is risk management. The more optionality a decision provides you with, the less risk you assume and the less you need to hedge. Low optionality decisions require significant hedging. No one can say what the future holds, optionality leads to adaptation which results in success.
