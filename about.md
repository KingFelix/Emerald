## About

Working in corporate environments for most of my career, I noticed how hard it is for large companies to adopt new technologies, even if they could help a lot in simplifying workflows or in the reduction of the time spent on certain activities. They all seem to have an undying love for Microsoft Excel. Now don't get me wrong, I think that Excel is a great tool but it tends to be used for everything you can think of, from simple tables for storing information, to data analysis and cleansing, to developing office software, without considering its limitations. The result is unstable and inefficient software (mainly macros) that is also full of bugs.     

### Alternatives
I took it upon myself to explore the web in search of new and interesting stuff, in search for tools/technologies that could help streamline activity (and maybe replace Excel), and give you my personal opinion on them. 

### Who am I?
A consultant with an innovative multinational company that provides IT services to large clients across the world. My main areas of interest are data analysis/data science and business intelligence and I mainly work with Python, R and Qlik and related tools and libraries.   

### What is the meaning of shift+return?
It's a keyboard shortcut you would use in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, for running the code in the current cell and then jumping on to the next one. If the next cell does not exist, a new one is created. Here, we're in the realm of studying and learning thus, in this particular context, the blog name is meant to convey the message that one should always go forward with their personal and professional development through learning. One should always be curious and, as soon as the current project comes to an end, they should go on to finding a new one. In other words, keep on moving, never stop!  

Stay curious!
