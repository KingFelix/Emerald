## About
Working in corporate environments for most of my career, I noticed how hard it is for large companies to adopt new technologies, even if they could help a lot in simplifying workflows or in the reduction of the time spent on certain activities. They all seem to have an undying love for Microsoft Excel. Now don't get me wrong, I think that Excel is a great tool but it tends to be used for everything you can think of, from simple tables for storing data to data analysis and cleansing, to developing office software, no matter its limitations. The result is unstable and inefficient software (mainly macros) that is also full of bugs.     

### Alternatives
I take it as my mission to explore the web in search of new and interesting stuff, in search for tools/technologies that could help streamline your activity, and give you my personal opinion on them. 

### Who am I?
A consultant with a large and innovative company that provides IT related services to large clients across the world. My main areas of interest are data analysis/data science and business intelligence and I mainly work with Python, R and Qlik and related tools/libraries.
